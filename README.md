## Abstract
With the new surveys and observatories like Square Kilometer Array (SKA), astronomers will produce a large amount of radio imaging data, and it is necessary to provide useful automatic algorithms for the classification of objects in survey images. Therefore, machine learning techniques, especially deep learning methods, have been successfully applied and became famous for the detection and classification of data in astronomical images. In this work, we present an approach based on the deep learning methods, which provides the very accurate morphological classification of radio galaxies from the survey known as Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST). We present an approach that combines architecture based on convolutional neural networks and data augmentation techniques for the training of the classifier. Input data consists of images of extended and compact radio galaxy sources, where extended radio galaxy sources are classified into three classes, Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type I, type II, and bent-tailed (BENT) radio galaxies. Our approach classifies compact radio galaxy sources with 100\% recall and extended radio galaxy sources with 99\% recall, with an average 99\% accuracy for all four classes.
