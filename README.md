## Abstract
Next generation radio surveys and observatories such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will produce massive amounts of radio imaging data. Traditional classification based on human visual inspection or using classical techniques of large numbers of sources with different morphologies is almost impossible.  Machine learning techniques, especially deep learning methods, have been increasingly used in astronomical applications and have proven to  successfully  classify objects in image data with high accuracy. Morphological classification of radio galaxies into different classes provides insights into central black holes and their accretion modes, interactions between radio galaxies, and can also be used  to probe dark matter, etc. The current work uses archival data from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) to classify radio galaxies into four classes: Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FRI), Fanaroff-Riley Class II (FRII), Bent-Tailed (BENT), and Compact (COMPT). The  model presented in this work for classifying radio galaxies is based on  deep learning methods. The model  combines architecture based on convolutional neural networks and data augmentation techniques for the training of the classifier. The proposed architecture comprises three parallel blocks of convolutional layers combined and processed for final classification by two feed-forward layers. Our model classified selected classes of radio galaxy sources on an independent testing subset with an average of 96% for precision, recall, and F1 score.  The current results show that the model developed in this work is able to identify different morphological classes of radio galaxies with a high efficiency and performance. Our classifier provides relatively simple architecture and outperforms previous works in recall and average accuracy.
